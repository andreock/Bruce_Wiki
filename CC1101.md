# Connection pinouts

**NOTE: CC1101 support is still experimental and not fully tested.**

To use the CC1101 in Bruce, turn off your M5 device and connect the module following the pinouts listed in this page.

After the next boot, if the CC1101 is initted correctly, you will find [2 new entries in the Config menu to enable the module](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/pull/148).

Tip: during boot on the serial log you will see `cc1101 Connection OK` or `cc1101 Connection Error`.

In case of a connection error, turn off the M5 device, recheck the wiring and try again.
