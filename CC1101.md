**NOTE: CC1101 support is still experimental and not fully tested. Also not yet available in the official releases**

# Setup

To use the CC1101 in Bruce, turn off your M5 device and connect the module following the pinouts listed in this page.

Turn on the device, then navigate to **"Config->RF Module"** and select "**CC1101 on SPI**" ([pics here](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/pull/148)).

If the "**CC1101 not found**" error message appears, turn off the M5 device, recheck the wiring and try again.

If no error is shown, then the CC1101 is initted correctly, and you can use it in the RF menu.

For this module you can also set a custom frequency in the supported subranges: **300-348 MHZ, 387-464 MHZ and 779-928 MHZ**. Setting an empty or invalid frequency will reset to the default **433.92 MHZ**. This frequency will only affect the **receive** features (Scan/replay). Transmitting from a `sub` file will always use the frequency specified inside the file.


# Connection pinouts

## M5StickC Plus2 and 1 pinouts

 - SS_PIN=26  ; chip select. wrongly labelled as "CKN" in some boards
 - MOSI_PIN=32
 - SCK_PIN=0
 - MISO_PIN=33

## Cardputer pinouts (still untested)

- from the groove connector:
