## What Is Bruce?

Bruce is meant to be a versatile ESP32 firmware that supports a ton of offensive features focusing to facilitate on Red Team operations. It also supports m5stack products and works great with Cardputer and Sticks.

<a name="purpose" />

## What Is Bruce For?

Bruce stems from a keen observation within the community focused on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offered a glimpse into the world of offensive security, there was a palpable sense that something more could be achieved without being that overpriced, particularly with the robust and modular hardware ecosystem provided by m5stack products.
