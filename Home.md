## What Is Bruce For?

Bruce stems from a keen observation within the community focused on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offered a glimpse into the world of offensive security, there was a palpable sense that something more could be achieved without being that overpriced, particularly with the robust and modular hardware ecosystem provided by m5stack products.
