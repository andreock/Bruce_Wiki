# RF
## Scan/Copy
Scan and copy RF signals in ASK/OOK modulation. It will start with the default frequency (433Mhz, common for M5 RF433R and FS1000A modules).
### Mode
**Decode**: tries to decode the signal with RCSwitch decoder
**RAW**: Will display RAW signals obtained from RCSwitch library.

### Filter
**Code**: On Decode mode, it will only display decoded signals. more reliable in noisy environments
**All**: will capture Decoded and RAW signals

### Replay
Send the last signal captured by Bruce.

### Save
Stores the signal into ./BruceRF of your SD Card or LittleFS**

### CC1101 only menu
#### Range
Choose the frequency to scan or a range to detect the frequency

#### Threshold
Choose the sensibility of the scanner. 
-60 to a more strict error frequency (more precise)
-80 to a more broad frequency (greater error, less precise)

## Record Raw
Records RAW signal using ESP32 RMT driver, displaying the raw signal obtained in a few seconds of capture.
The recording will start once it detects a minimum signal on the input.
If using CC1101, you can choose the frequency you want to record.
In this function you can Save, and replay signals.

## Custom SubGhz (limited compatibility)
Transmits signals stored in **.sub** files, they can be the ones saved by Bruce in the BruceRF folder or others downloaded from internet.

## Spectrum Analysis
Displays waveform signals if RF frequencies are detected.

## Squarewave Spectrum
When signals are detected, it displays a squarewave based on the timings of the signal.

## Jammer Full
Starts a full square signal on the output, jamming the RF spectrum in the 433Mhz area, or in the **RF Frequecy** set in the Config Menu (if using CC1101)

## Jammer Intermittent
Starts a PWM signal on the output, jamming the signal, not harming the transmitter, if listening to the frequency with a radio, yoÂ´'ll be able to hear a "weeeoooooiiiiiioooooeeee" sound

## Config
### RF TX Pin and RF RX Pin
If using M5Stack, FS1000A or other single pin module to transmit the signal, here is where you can choose the pin

### RF Module
#### M5 RF433T/R 
M5 RF433T/R modules or unofficial modules.
#### CC1101
If you are using a StickCPlus (1.1 or 2), you will be presented to two options of CC1101
##### CC1101 (legacy)
This setup is designed to use only the CC1101 in the bus, using [THIS setup](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/blob/main/media/connections/cc1101_stick.jpg)


##### CC1101 (Shared SPI)
This setup is designed to share the SPI bus with the SD Card, but in this case you ned to add a transistor into the circuit, using [THIS Setup](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/blob/main/media/connections/cc1101_stick_SDCard.jpg)

# Replay Payloads Like Flipper!

Bruce can now send raw formats similar to those supported in [this repository](https://github.com/Zero-Sploit/FlipperZero-Subghz-DB/tree/main/subghz).

## Methods to Transmit `.sub` Files:

1. Via the **Custom SubGhz** app in the **RF** menu.
2. Via the **SDCard/LittleFS** file manager in the **Files** menu.
3. Via the **WebUI** by clicking the [antenna-like button next to the file](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/pull/124).
4. Via a [serial command](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce/wiki/Serial), such as:
